# NanoImprint

R markdown code for creating the output of NanoImprint. Copy the code to a R markdown document, download ctrl dataframe and load in your data. Data must be obtained from modbam2bed included in the Human variation workflow provided by ONTs epi2me labs. Both phased (using --phase_methyl argument) and unphased (--methyl argument) BED files should be created and sorted with BEDTools intersected before use. Sorting to the included regions can be done using the region_T2T.bed file.
